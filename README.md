# Indian Heritage

This project is for the WebWonders event organized by the Nexus club in SVNIT. This project follows a MVC type format:

- _M_ stands for Models, this is where we will store our Mongodb Schema

- _V_ stands for Views, this is where the frontend will reside, EJS is our templating engine in this project

- _C_ stands for Controllers, JS middleware functions which are executed on certain routes
